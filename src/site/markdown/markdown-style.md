Markdown style
=============

[Markdown][] content must start with a header that is written in the form.

````
Header text
===========
````

### Word wrapping

There should be **no line breaks in between paragraphs**, instead it is expected that [Markdown][] editors would wrap text automatically.

### Sections

Document sections are marked with `###` (three hashes).  Further subsections can use `####` and more but **do not use `#` or `##`**.
