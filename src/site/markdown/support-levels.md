Support levels
==============

Unless otherwise noted on a project, these are the support levels for artifacts that are 
presently released by [Trajano][].

For Java SE projects, the supported version of Java is based on the Java SE level that is 
currently supported by [IBM WebSphere Application Server][1].  There won't be any support
guaranteed for JREs older than that version which is presently `6.0` at the time of writing.

For Maven plug-ins and extensions such as [wagon-git] and [batik-maven-plugin], the supported
version depends on the currently embedded with the [M2E] that is released with Eclipsei at
minimum up to the current stable release of Maven.  These are 3.0.4 to 3.2.1 at the time of
writing.

Artifacts must be buildable and usable on Mac, Windows and Linux platforms.
